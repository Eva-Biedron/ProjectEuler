    "- I reduced the number of total combinations in two ways: I only check 'a' up to half of the summed value and I only check 'b' up to half of the summed value minus 1. If you consider a + b + c = s and set a to 1 (the lowest natural number) and s to 100, then c + b = 1000 - 1. Then if you consider that b must be less than c, then the greatest b could be is c - 1, giving c + c - 1 = 1000 - 1 condensing to 2c - 1 = 999. Solving for c gives 1000 / 2 or 500, making b 499.\n",
